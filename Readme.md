# Resynthesizer Gradio

Resynthesizer is a very old (2000 year) open-source equivalent to Adobe Photoshop's "Content-Aware Fill" feature

This gradio demo integrates compiled wasm build of [61315's Standalone implementation of resynthesizer](https://github.com/61315/resynthesizer) inside iframe and allows interactions with it

How binary was build: [build.md](build.md)
